			</h4>
			<br>
			<p>
				This course prepares the student for a career in web development. The student will expand their knowledge of the emerging web technologies while applying sound design methodologies to frontend web development. This multi-faceted course introduces the student to a variety of web development tools and the role of a web designer focused on user interface design. The student will also spend a large portion of the semester transforming interface designs and wire frames into functioning web sites using Adobe Brackets, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other web technologies as necessary. Offered Spring Semester, annually.

				Located on the arcade level of the Whitaker Center for Science and the Arts, the $2 million completed project marks the second collaboration between the Whitaker Center and HU. The first project was completed last year, when HU transformed the Whitaker Center’s Stage II area into a state-of-the-art practice facility for its eSports team, the HU Storm.

				The 7,950-square-foot Student Union Center features dedicated collaborative learning and small group areas, private study and conference rooms, student club meeting space, an aquaponics lab outfitted with a video monitoring system for guests, fitness and gaming areas, and a self-service kitchen.

				A portion of the Whitaker Center’s interconnecting stairwell has been altered to separate the science center from the Student Union Center, which also boasts a mezzanine for fitness and aerobic classes, and private study and gaming areas.
