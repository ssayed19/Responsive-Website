				The Harrisburg Mall is a regional mall located just outside Harrisburg in Swatara Township, Pennsylvania. It is the largest mall in the Harrisburg area. The anchor store is Bass Pro Shops. There are 2 vacant anchor stores that were once Macy's and Boscov's. The mall, formerly known as the Harrisburg East Mall, opened in 1969 with JCPenney, Wanamaker's, and Gimbels as anchors.[1] During construction a natural limestone cave known variously as Big Pit, Paxtang or Crystal Paradise Cave known for its anthodite and speleothem formations was uncovered.
